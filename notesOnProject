this project was challenging but fun. I learned a lot about react, jsx, and github in the process.
next iterations of the project would include a sum under each column and better stylizing in css.
i would include a top buffer area, some nice boxes with proper shadows.
i also have to fix the issue of having the formatting of the score card being strange upon squishing it to a smaller window.
overall, a fun time!
